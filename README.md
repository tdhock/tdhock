Hi! I have been working on machine learning and statistical software
(especially using R/Python/C/C++/JavaScript) since my undergrad in
Berkeley Stats (BS 2006), and my PhD in Paris (2012). Since 2024 I
work as a Tenured Associate Professor in Université de Sherbrooke,
Département d'Informatique, where I direct the [LASSO research
lab](https://lassolab.org/) (Learning Algorithms, Statistical
Software, Optimization). 
See [my web page for complete
CV](https://tdhock.github.io/).

I have published 50+ peer-reviewed research papers on machine learning and statistical software. 
My research emphasizes fast, accurate, and interpretable algorithms for learning from large data, using continuous optimization (clustering, regression, ranking, classification) and discrete optimization (changepoint detection, dynamic programming). The main application domains for these algorithms are genomics, neuroscience, medicine, microbiome, cybersecurity, robotics, satellite/sonar imagery, climate/carbon modeling. [See my Publications page for more info](https://tdhock.github.io/publications/).

I have mentored 30+ students in research projects, as well as another 30+ open-source software contributors with R Project in Google Summer of Code.
[See my Teaching page for a list of students mentored](https://tdhock.github.io/teaching/).

I think reproducible research is important, so in addition to every research paper, I also provide

* Source code for doing the analyses and creating the figures,
  typically in a GitHub repo. [See "Reproducible" links on my
  Publications page](https://tdhock.github.io/publications/).
* A reference implementation of the algorithm(s) described in the
  paper, typically as an R package. [See my Software
  page](https://tdhock.github.io/software/).
